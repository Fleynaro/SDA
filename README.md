# What is it?
SDA is a rich tool for reverse engineering that focused firstly on analysis of computer games.
I'm trying to create a mix of the Ghidra, the Cheat Engine, the x64dbg. My tool will combine static and dynamic analysis of programs.

# Features
SDA has the features:
- Decompiler that has been developed from scratch (better than Ghidra in some cases).
- Symbol/data type/function/... editors.
- Assembler code viewer.
- Function graph viewer.
- other
