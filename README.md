# What is it?
SDA is a rich cross-platform tool for reverse engineering that focused firstly on analysis of computer games. I'm trying to create a mix of the Ghidra, Cheat Engine and x64dbg. My tool will combine static and dynamic analysis of programs.

Now SDA is being developed. You can use it only as demo as there are many bugs and there is much to do.

# Features
SDA has the features:
- Decompiler that has been developed from scratch (better than Ghidra in some cases)
- Symbol/data type/function/... editors
- Assembler code viewer
- Function graph viewer
- PCode debugger that is platform and processor independent
- Many others
